In Azure DevOps, navigate to Pipelines and create a new pipeline.
Select your repository and configure the pipeline using the YAML file.

2.Define the Pipeline YAML:
Create a azure-pipelines.yml file in your project root with the following content

3.Run the Pipeline:
Save and run the pipeline to build, test, and deploy your .NET application.

# Azure DevOps pipeline to deploy the .NET application to a development environment 
Step 1: Define the Pipeline YAML

In the Azure portal, create a new Web App under your desired resource group and subscription.
2.Update Pipeline with Web App Details:
Replace YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION with the name of your Azure service connection.
Replace YOUR_APP_NAME with the name of your Azure Web App.

Step 4: Run the Pipeline

1.Commit and Push Changes:
Commit your changes to the azure-pipelines.yml file and push them to your repository.
The pipeline will trigger automatically based on the master branch.

2.Monitor the Pipeline:
Check the pipeline runs in Azure DevOps to ensure the build and deployment steps are executed correctly.
If the build fails, you will receive an email notification with the failure details.
